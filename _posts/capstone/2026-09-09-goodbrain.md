> My Good Brain's website has a minimalistic and colorful layout with certain elements which would be good to learn as we make progress. However, the website doesn't have strong backend features, contains cluttered information, and lacks an interactive, organized hub.

<!-- Section 1: Why We Chose This Organization -->
<strong id="why-we-chose-this" class="text-3xl font-bold block mb-2">Why We Chose My Good Brain</strong>
<p class="mt-2 text-base leading-relaxed">
    My Good Brain does amazing work promoting youth mental health wellness by connecting emotional expression with art and creative design. It combined our interest in neuroscience, mental health, and community. When our team was looking for a capstone project, we connected with their mission of mental health resources for a community to feel welcoming, positive, and approachable rather than overwhelming or clinical.
</p>
<p class="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed">
    However, when we explored their current website, we realized there was a big gap between their real-world impact and their digital setup. The site has vibrant artwork and strong branding, but it feels more like a static brochure than an active community space. Important resources are buried under vague menus, key information relies on default iframe embeds, and there isn't much to keep kids, parents, or educators engaged once they land on the page.
</p>
<p class="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed">
    We chose My Good Brain because we saw a huge opportunity to turn their platform into a true interactive hub. Our capstone focuses on modernizing their layout, fixing their navigation, and building functional tools like digital art prompts and structured activity hubs that give visitors a real reason to explore, participate, and keep coming back.
