    <p class="ocs__description">The idea, why it's designed this way, where it stands today, and how it compares to what already exists. See the <a href="/capstone/presence-system/">Overview</a> page for the problem statement and research question.</p>

    <h3 class="ocs__section-title">The Idea, in One Paragraph</h3>
    <p class="rfid-presence-question">The goal is to know each student's actual instructional minutes in the room and who's currently missing, without a teacher taking or visually verifying attendance. Three inputs are being evaluated toward that goal: RFID tap (Vibha), QR scan (Ruta), and face scan (Kush), each tracked separately in the <a href="https://github.com/vibha1019/crowpi-attendance/issues/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presence System Index</a>. The rest of this page zooms into the most-developed pairing so far: RFID tap correlated with an existing face-scanning camera system built by a teammate on another OCS project.</p>
    <p class="rfid-presence-question">Mount a tamper-evident RFID tag on each student's own laptop, not a wearable badge, since laptops are far less likely to be left in a locker, and read it at the classroom door. That tells us the <strong>device</strong> is present. The camera separately tells us the <strong>student</strong> is present. Neither signal alone is trustworthy attendance: a laptop can sit in the room while its owner is in the bathroom, and a face can be recognized without the device belonging to that class period. Correlating RFID and camera against the bell schedule and per-period roster produces a real presence determination for that pairing.</p>

      <li class="done"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>Security review is mentor-led rather than a formal school-IT process, given the single-room scope and open-sharing policy.</span></li>

    <h3 class="ocs__section-title">Where It Stands Today</h3>
    <p class="rfid-presence-about">The RFID track has a working contact-tap prototype on a CrowPi board, with one scan pad, a Flask backend integrated into OCS, and a live dashboard, proving the core read, log, and display loop end to end. It does not yet include the camera correlation, UHF doorway detection, or tamper-evident tags described above; that hardware work is intentionally paused until the research cycles show it's worth deepening. QR and camera integration have not started.</p>
    <div class="ocs__callout">
      Current status per track is on the <a href="/capstone/presence-system/">Overview</a> page. What the paused later hardware stages would involve is on the <a href="/capstone/presence-system/phases/">Phases</a> page.

  <div class="ocs__card">
    <h3 class="ocs__section-title">Prior Research &amp; Comparable Systems</h3>
    <p class="rfid-presence-about">This research is specific to the RFID and camera pairing above; QR has a separate, much smaller literature base not yet reviewed here. A survey of academic work, related patents, commercial products, and regulatory sources reviewed before finalizing this design, covering classroom attendance systems directly and the underlying RF, sensor-fusion, and UX questions the design depends on (on-body tag reliability, antenna diversity, tag co-location interference, clock synchronization, and audible read confirmation). This is a September 2026 research snapshot, not a formal literature review or patent-clearance search; a proper IP-clearance pass should happen before any claim of novelty is made publicly.</p>

    <p class="rfid-presence-about">The team flagged an open problem: a tagged laptop inside a closed backpack has no guaranteed orientation toward the reader, and UHF read reliability drops off-axis. The same physics is a bigger problem for a tag carried on the body (e.g. a phone in a pocket), since human tissue absorbs strongly at UHF. It turns out to be a known, actively studied RFID engineering problem rather than something specific to this project's design, and the standard mitigation (surrounding the doorway with multiple antennas instead of relying on one) is the same technique retail and library security gates already use.</p>

      All three BLE approaches above depend on the student running an app and keeping Bluetooth and location permissions on, a policy and compliance dependency this project avoids by using a passive RFID tag, which requires no app, no permissions, and no student action beyond carrying the tagged device. The tradeoff is that RFID needs dedicated reader hardware at the doorway, where BLE reuses infrastructure the student already carries.

    <p class="rfid-presence-about">The team has discussed giving students an audible tone at the doorway on a successful read, so they get positive proof their crossing was registered rather than trusting a silent background scan. This is not a new idea in RFID systems generally.</p>

    <p class="rfid-presence-about">The door portal's power budget is governed by federal rule, not a tuning choice, so it's worth citing the primary regulatory text rather than a vendor's paraphrase of it.</p>

The commonly quoted "4&nbsp;W EIRP" ceiling is the <em>derived</em> maximum under that 6&nbsp;dBi allowance (1&nbsp;W &times; ~4x from 6&nbsp;dBi gain), not a number stated directly in the rule, so it's worth being precise about when citing it.</td>

    <ul class="ocs__checklist">
      <li class="done"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>The tag is mounted on the student's own laptop, not a badge or ID card. It is a device-presence proxy, not a person-presence proxy.</span></li>
      <li class="done"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>Tags are tamper-evident, with an explicit issue, active, tampered/lost, and reissued/retired lifecycle.</span></li>
      <li class="done"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>Presence is a multi-state model (tardy, stepped out, left early, opted out, tamper) rather than a binary present/absent flag.</span></li>
      <li class="done"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>Attendance counts only inside a bell-schedule-bound window, evaluated against per-period expected enrollment.</span></li>
      <li class="done"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>The camera signal carries an explicit opt-in governance model, built in from the start rather than added later.</span></li>
      <li class="done"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>The hardware rollout is deliberately phased and currently paused after contact-tap: harder contactless work only resumes once the research cycles show it's worth building, not built up front on assumption.</span></li>
      <li class="done"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>The doorway is designed as a multi-antenna, circularly-polarized portal from the start (the same antenna-diversity technique library and retail security gates use) rather than a single reader antenna, because tag orientation at a walk-through point is inherently unpredictable.</span></li>
      <li class="done"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>An audible read-confirmation tone at the doorway is being evaluated so a student has positive proof their crossing registered, rather than trusting a silent background scan, a pattern with real precedent in RFID reader hardware and library systems but not common in the classroom-attendance literature surveyed above.</span></li>
