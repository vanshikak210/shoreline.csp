    <h1 class="rfid-presence-title">System Architecture &amp; Data Flow</h1>
    <p class="ocs__description">How the RFID and camera signals get correlated into an attendance record, the most-developed of the three input tracks, for readers who want the mechanism and not just the pitch. QR follows the same event API once it's generalized.</p>

    <h3 class="ocs__section-title">System Architecture</h3>
    <p class="rfid-presence-about">For the RFID and camera pairing: two independent event sources feed a correlation engine that is also aware of the bell schedule and per-period enrollment. QR would feed the same engine as a third source once integrated.</p>

    <h3 class="ocs__section-title">Attendance Window Logic</h3>
    <p class="rfid-presence-about">The bell schedule doesn't just define start and end times for tardy math. It defines a <strong>window</strong> during which reads count as attendance at all.</p>
    <div class="ocs__diagram">
      <pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram
    participant Bell as Bell Schedule
    participant Win as Attendance Window
    participant Door as Door Sensors (RFID)
    participant Cam as Camera System
    participant Eng as Correlation Engine

    Bell->>Win: Period starts -> window opens
    loop While window is open
        Door->>Eng: tag read (device event)
        Cam->>Eng: face/spatial event (student event)
        Eng->>Eng: correlate device + student signals
    end
    Bell->>Win: Period ends -> window closes
    Note over Eng: Any tag/camera event outside the window is logged but NOT counted as attendance</pre>

    <h3 class="ocs__section-title">Presence State Model</h3>
    <p class="rfid-presence-about">For the RFID and camera pairing: two independent signals, device via RFID and student via camera, get correlated into one of these states per student per period.</p>
    <div class="ocs__diagram">
      <pre class="mermaid">stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ABSENT
    ABSENT --> PRESENT: device + student seen in window
    ABSENT --> TARDY: first seen after grace period
    PRESENT --> DEVICE_PRESENT_STUDENT_AWAY: student signal drops
    DEVICE_PRESENT_STUDENT_AWAY --> PRESENT: student signal returns
    PRESENT --> LEFT_EARLY: both signals stop before window close
    PRESENT --> DEVICE_ABSENT_STUDENT_PRESENT: device signal drops, student still seen
    TARDY --> PRESENT: settles once both signals confirmed
    [*] --> DEVICE_ONLY_NO_CONSENT: device seen, camera opted out
    [*] --> TAMPER_DETECTED: tag reports tamper
    [*] --> IGNORED_OUT_OF_WINDOW: read outside attendance window</pre>

    <p class="rfid-presence-about">No code yet for the full model. This is the entity list, not a schema.</p>
    <ul class="ocs__entity-list">
      <li><strong>Students</strong>: id, name, enrolled periods</li>
      <li><strong>Periods</strong>: id, name, start time, end time, expected enrollment</li>
      <li><strong>Computers</strong>: id, assigned student</li>
      <li><strong>RFID Tags</strong>: UID, linked computer, status (active/tampered/retired), issue date</li>
      <li><strong>Registrations</strong>: student, face ID, computer, and tag, the four-way binding</li>
      <li><strong>Doors</strong>: id, room, side (front/back)</li>
      <li><strong>RFID Events</strong>: tag UID, door, timestamp</li>
      <li><strong>Camera Events</strong>: student (via face match), timestamp, spatial zone; stub interface into the face-scanning system</li>
      <li><strong>Attendance Windows</strong>: derived per period from the bell schedule</li>

    <h3 class="ocs__section-title">Current Software Stack (RFID Track)</h3>
    <ul class="ocs__entity-list">
      <li><strong>Reader board</strong>: CrowPi, single scan pad, 13.56MHz MIFARE Classic tags. Contact-tap, not the UHF doorway design above.</li>
      <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Flask, integrated into OCS. Real authentication on admin routes and moving off the dev server are still open, tracked in <a href="https://github.com/vibha1019/crowpi-attendance/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Issue #6</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Database</strong>: OCS's own database via the shared attendance API; the standalone prototype's separate SQLite database is being phased out.</li>
      <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: a live dashboard, running locally on the team's own network.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="ocs__callout">
      The full RFID and camera architecture above is the <strong>target design</strong> for that pairing. The current running system implements only the leftmost slice of it: RFID read, log, dashboard, with no camera correlation yet, and that gap is intentionally not being closed until the research cycles justify it. See <a href="/capstone/presence-system/phases/">Phases</a> for what's paused and why.

  <div class="ocs__card">
    <h3 class="ocs__section-title">Open Technical Questions</h3>
    <ul class="ocs__checklist">
      <li class="open"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>Bag-orientation reliability: a tagged laptop inside a closed backpack has no guaranteed tag-to-reader orientation, and UHF read reliability drops off-axis. Not yet solved. See <a href="/capstone/presence-system/summary/">Project Summary</a> for candidate antenna designs that address this directly.</span></li>
      <li class="open"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>Camera system interface: what the face-scanning system exposes (API, event stream, or file) still needs to be defined, including how it reports a student who has opted out.</span></li>
      <li class="open"><span class="ocs__checklist-box"></span><span>Tag mounting standard: a single mounting spot on the laptop (for example, the underside near a plastic vent) so tag type (on-metal versus standard) can be standardized across devices.</span></li>
