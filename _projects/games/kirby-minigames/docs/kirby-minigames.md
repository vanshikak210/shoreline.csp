## Goal

Build a connected minigame experience that starts in an aquatic story level, transitions into a seek-and-collect game, and ends in a basketball survival challenge.

This project also adds replay systems and technical features beyond a basic level build, including game-in-game transitions, collision logic, enemy chasing behavior, optional multiplayer, and level-specific music.

## What We Built

### Aquatic level

- A story-based underwater level with Mermaid, Slime, Kirby, Shark, and Shark wingman NPCs
- Quest #1 where the player collects starfishes for Mermaid
- Quest #2 where the player goes above water and removes floating trash
- A quest HUD that updates as the player progresses through the story
- A boss fight against the Megalodon with separate combat rules and UI
- A challenge mode with its own score tracking and leaderboard

The Megalodon boss fight acts like a final combat phase for the aquatic level instead of a normal NPC interaction. When the fight starts, the game switches to a separate boss HUD with boss health, player health, and combat-only rules. The Megalodon can attack with different abilities, summon sharks during the fight, and become more dangerous at low health. The player can fight back using the aquatic combat system, collect helpful orbs during the battle, and win by fully depleting the boss health bar.

### Seek minigame

- A coin-collection minigame with a playground background
- A custom in-game sprite menu opened with `Q`
- Automatic transition to the next minigame after all coins are collected

### Basketball minigame

- A survival game where Astro is chased by Kirby across the court
- Coin collection, invisible court barriers, timer HUD, restart flow, and leaderboard logic
- A projectile basketball attack on `E` that can stun the chaser

### Shared technical features

- Game-in-game level transitions
- Collision and hitbox logic
- NPC chasing behavior
- Optional two-player aquatic multiplayer
- Level-specific music with a reusable controller

## Implementing Enemies (Team Ocean)

### Megalodon boss fight

The boss fight is mainly controlled through a shared `bossState` object in `GameLevelAquaticGameLevel.js`. This object stores the boss health, player combat health, cooldowns, summons, projectiles, and orb buffs in one place so the rest of the fight logic can read and update the same combat state.

```javascript
this.bossState = {
  active: false,
  combatReady: false,
  hp: 2100,
  maxHp: 2100,
  playerHp: 165,
  playerMaxHp: 165,
  summons: [],
  projectiles: [],
  enemyProjectiles: [],
  laserBeam: null,
  cooldowns: {
    laser: 3400,
    rockets: 5200,
    bodySwing: 4300
  },
  lowHealthSummonStartedAt: 0,
  nextOrbSpawnAt: 0,
  orbs: [],
  buffs: createBossOrbBuffState()
};
```

This matters because the fight is not handled by one giant attack sequence. Instead, the game keeps boss data in one state object and updates that state every frame.

The phase logic is handled in `handleBossHealthPhases()`. This function checks the Megalodon's remaining health and unlocks new behavior as the fight goes on.

```javascript
const thresholds = [0.75, 0.5, 0.25];
thresholds.forEach((threshold) => {
  if (
    this.bossState.hp <= this.bossState.maxHp * threshold &&
    !this.bossState.summonThresholdsTriggered.includes(threshold)
  ) {
    this.bossState.summonThresholdsTriggered.push(threshold);
    summonRushingSharks(threshold > 0.5 ? 2 : 4);
  }
});

if (this.bossState.hp <= this.bossState.maxHp * 0.25) {
  summonWeakenedMegalodon();
}

if (this.bossState.hp <= this.bossState.maxHp * 0.1) {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (!this.bossState.lowHealthSummonStartedAt) {
    this.bossState.lowHealthSummonStartedAt = now;
  } else if (now - this.bossState.lowHealthSummonStartedAt >= 1000) {
    summonRushingSharks(1);
    this.bossState.lowHealthSummonStartedAt = now;
  }
}
```

This code means the fight escalates in phases instead of staying flat. At different health percentages, the boss summons extra sharks, gains a weakened Megalodon support enemy, and at very low health starts summoning sharks repeatedly.

The boss attack loop is updated in `updateBossCombat()`. That function decides which ability is active and swaps the boss animation sheet to match the current attack.

```javascript
const startAbility = (name, durationMs) => {
  state.activeAbility = name;
  state.abilityEndsAt = Date.now() + durationMs;
  state.abilityCommitted = false;
  state.lastAbilityAt[name] = Date.now();
  state.nextAbilityAt = Date.now() + state.abilityGlobalCooldownMs;
  setBossSpriteSheet(state.megalodonAttackSheet, state.megalodonAttackPixels);

  if (name === 'laser') {
    boss.direction = 'laserAttack';
  } else if (name === 'rockets') {
    boss.direction = 'rocketAttack';
  } else {
    state.swingHitsLeft = 2;
    boss.direction = 'swingAttackA';
  }
};
```

This is the part that makes the boss feel like a real encounter instead of a sprite with contact damage. The Megalodon can switch between multiple attacks, and each attack changes timing, animation, and damage behavior.

The fight also includes orb pickups that help the player survive. `spawnCombatOrb()` creates floating collectible buffs during the battle and applies the selected orb effect when the player touches it.

```javascript
const spawnCombatOrb = () => {
  if (!this.bossState.active || !this.bossState.combatReady) return;

  const definition = getOrbWeightedSelection();
  const spawn = getSafeSpawnPoint();
  const orb = new Collectible({
    id: `aquatic_orb_${definition.key}_${Date.now()}`,
    src: definition.sprite,
    INIT_POSITION: spawn,
    greeting: definition.message,
    dialogues: [definition.message],
    interact: function() {
      activateOrb(definition);
      levelContext.bossState.orbs = (levelContext.bossState.orbs || []).filter((entry) => entry.obj !== this);
      this.destroy();
    }
  }, gameEnv);
};
```

That gives the boss fight a second layer beyond just dodging attacks. The player is also reacting to timed power-up spawns and using those buffs to handle laser hits, shark bites, speed boosts, and counterplay.

### Game-in-Game transitions (Group of Three)

One of the biggest features we added was a real game-in-game transition flow instead of leaving each minigame isolated.

The sequence is:

1. `GameLevelAquaticGameLevel` launches `GameLevelSeek`
2. `GameLevelSeek` tears itself down and transitions into `GameLevelBasketball`
3. Fade overlays and cleanup logic prevent the canvases and UI from stacking on top of each other

The aquatic level uses `GameControl` to start Seek as a nested game:

```javascript
const gameInGame = new GameControl(this.gameEnv.game, [GameLevelSeek], {
  parentControl: primaryGame,
});
gameInGame.start();
```

This works because the aquatic level first pauses the parent game and hides the existing canvas state before starting the nested level. That lets us keep the larger story level alive while the player enters a smaller minigame inside it.

Seek then transitions forward by tearing down its current level and handing control back up the chain:

```javascript
const transitionOverlay = document.createElement('div');
transitionOverlay.style.opacity = '0';
transitionOverlay.style.transition = 'opacity 900ms ease';
document.body.appendChild(transitionOverlay);

requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  transitionOverlay.style.opacity = '1';
});

setTimeout(() => {
  topGame.currentLevelIndex = basketballIndex;
  topGame.transitionToLevel();
}, 950);
```

This matches the game-in-game lesson pattern because the project is not just changing scenes visually. It is creating, fading, destroying, and replacing active game levels in a controlled sequence.

## Code Breakdown

### Megalodon boss fight breakdown

## PART 1 - Storing the whole fight in one state object

The aquatic level keeps the full boss fight inside one shared object instead of scattering combat data across random variables.

```js
this.bossState = {
  active: false,
  hp: 2100,
  playerHp: 165,
  summons: [],
  projectiles: [],
  enemyProjectiles: [],
  buffs: createBossOrbBuffState()
};
```

- `active` = whether the boss fight is currently running
- `hp` = Megalodon health
- `playerHp` = player combat health for the boss phase
- `summons` and `projectiles` = extra combat objects spawned during the fight
- `buffs` = temporary orb effects that change combat behavior

## PART 2 - Unlocking new boss behavior by health thresholds

The fight becomes harder by checking health percentages instead of running one flat attack pattern.

```js
if (
  this.bossState.hp <= this.bossState.maxHp * threshold &&
  !this.bossState.summonThresholdsTriggered.includes(threshold)
) {
  this.bossState.summonThresholdsTriggered.push(threshold);
  summonRushingSharks(threshold > 0.5 ? 2 : 4);
}
```

- `hp <= maxHp * threshold` = checks whether the boss crossed a phase breakpoint
- `summonThresholdsTriggered` = prevents the same phase from firing twice
- `summonRushingSharks(...)` = adds pressure as the fight escalates

## PART 3 - Spawning orb power-ups during combat

The boss fight is not only about dodging. It also drops timed buffs the player can collect.

```js
const orb = new Collectible({
  id: `aquatic_orb_${definition.key}_${Date.now()}`,
  src: definition.sprite,
  interact: function() {
    activateOrb(definition);
    this.destroy();
  }
}, gameEnv);
```

- `Collectible` = reuses the engine's collectible system for combat buffs
- `definition.sprite` = decides what the orb looks like
- `activateOrb(definition)` = applies the orb effect
- `this.destroy()` = removes the orb after pickup

### Game-in-game transition breakdown

## PART 1 - Starting a nested minigame from Aquatic

The aquatic level launches Seek as a new `GameControl` instead of treating it like a simple cutscene.

```js
const gameInGame = new GameControl(this.gameEnv.game, [GameLevelSeek], {
  parentControl: primaryGame,
});
gameInGame.start();
```

- `new GameControl(...)` = creates a fresh game controller for the subgame
- `[GameLevelSeek]` = tells that controller which level to run
- `parentControl` = keeps a link back to the main game
- `start()` = begins the nested level

## PART 2 - Fading from Seek into Basketball

Seek does not swap instantly anymore. It creates an overlay and waits before transitioning.

```js
const transitionOverlay = document.createElement('div');
transitionOverlay.style.opacity = '0';
transitionOverlay.style.transition = 'opacity 900ms ease';
document.body.appendChild(transitionOverlay);
```

- `createElement('div')` = builds the fullscreen fade layer
- `opacity = '0'` = starts invisible
- `transition` = tells the browser to animate the opacity change
- `appendChild()` = places the overlay on the page

## PART 3 - Handing control back up the chain

After the fade starts, Seek finds the top controller and tells it to load Basketball.

```js
const primaryGame = this.gameEnv?.gameControl;
const topGame = primaryGame?.parentControl || primaryGame;
topGame.currentLevelIndex = basketballIndex;
topGame.transitionToLevel();
```

- `primaryGame` = the current Seek controller
- `parentControl` = the original game that launched Seek
- `currentLevelIndex` = points to the Basketball level
- `transitionToLevel()` = performs the actual level swap

### Collision logic breakdown

## PART 1 - Building hitbox rectangles

Basketball first turns sprite positions into smaller collision rectangles.

```js
return {
  left:   pos.x + widthReduction,
  right:  pos.x + width - widthReduction,
  top:    pos.y + heightReduction,
  bottom: pos.y + height
};
```

- `left/right/top/bottom` = the edges of the hitbox
- `widthReduction` and `heightReduction` = shrink the hitbox to feel fairer
- smaller hitboxes = less frustrating collision detection

## PART 2 - Detecting when Kirby catches the player

The round ends when the two hitboxes overlap.

```js
if (this.isHitboxCollision(player, lebron)) {
  this.caught = true;
  this.caughtAt = now;
  this.showCaughtMessage();
}
```

- `isHitboxCollision()` = checks rectangle overlap
- `caught = true` = switches the game into the caught state
- `caughtAt` = stores when the collision happened
- `showCaughtMessage()` = shows the reset warning on screen

## PART 3 - Projectile collision uses a different shape

Thrown basketballs use circle-to-rectangle collision instead of player-to-player overlap.

```js
const nearestX = Math.max(rect.left, Math.min(projectile.x, rect.right));
const nearestY = Math.max(rect.top,  Math.min(projectile.y, rect.bottom));
const dx = projectile.x - nearestX;
const dy = projectile.y - nearestY;
```

- `nearestX` and `nearestY` = closest point on the target hitbox
- `dx` and `dy` = distance from the projectile center to that point
- this method works better for round projectiles than plain rectangle overlap

### NPC chasing behavior breakdown

## PART 1 - Measuring direction toward the player

Kirby needs to know where the player is every frame before it can chase.

```js
const dx = player.position.x - lebron.position.x;
const dy = player.position.y - lebron.position.y;
const dist = Math.hypot(dx, dy);
if (dist < 1) return;
```

- `dx` = horizontal difference
- `dy` = vertical difference
- `Math.hypot(dx, dy)` = true distance between the two characters
- `return` = stops jitter when the distance is tiny

## PART 2 - Converting distance into controlled movement

The chaser uses the direction to move a little each frame instead of teleporting.

```js
const speed = Math.min(2.1 + this.currentTime * 0.03, 2.8);
lebron.position.x += (dx / dist) * speed;
lebron.position.y += (dy / dist) * speed;
```

- `dx / dist` and `dy / dist` = normalized direction
- `speed` = chase speed for that frame
- `currentTime * 0.03` = slowly ramps up the difficulty
- `Math.min(..., 2.8)` = keeps the chase capped

## PART 3 - Pointing the sprite the right way

The code also changes Kirby's facing direction so the chase reads visually.

```js
if (Math.abs(dx) > Math.abs(dy)) {
  lebron.direction = dx >= 0 ? 'right' : 'left';
} else {
  lebron.direction = dy >= 0 ? 'down' : 'up';
}
```

- compares horizontal and vertical pressure
- picks the stronger axis
- updates the sprite direction to match movement

### Multiplayer system breakdown

## PART 1 - Turning a URL room into multiplayer state

Aquatic enables co-op by reading a `room` value and using it to build a shared channel name.

```js
const multiplayerRoom = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('room') || '';
this.multiplayer = {
  enabled: Boolean(multiplayerRoom),
  room: multiplayerRoom,
  channelName: `aquatic_multiplayer_${multiplayerRoom}`,
};
```

- `URLSearchParams(...)` = reads query string settings from the page URL
- `enabled` = flips multiplayer on or off
- `room` = the lobby name
- `channelName` = the communication key for that lobby

## PART 2 - Choosing a transport layer

The level prefers `BroadcastChannel`, but falls back to browser storage events if needed.

```js
if (typeof BroadcastChannel !== 'undefined') {
  const channel = new BroadcastChannel(this.multiplayer.channelName);
  channel.onmessage = (event) => handleMultiplayerMessage(event.data);
  this.multiplayer.channel = channel;
}
```

- `BroadcastChannel` = direct tab-to-tab communication
- `channelName` = makes sure only the same room shares messages
- `onmessage` = receives updates from the other player
- fallback logic exists for browsers that do not support the channel API

## PART 3 - Sending heartbeat updates

The local player broadcasts position updates on a timer so the other client can draw them.

```js
this.multiplayer.heartbeatTimer = setInterval(() => {
  broadcastMultiplayerMessage({
    type: "state",
    x: player.position?.x || 0,
    y: player.position?.y || 0,
    direction: player.direction || "down",
  });
}, 120);
```

- `setInterval(..., 120)` = sends updates about every 120ms
- `type: "state"` = marks this as a movement packet
- `x`, `y`, `direction` = enough data to mirror the other player

### Music system breakdown

## PART 1 - Reusing an existing audio class

Instead of writing a new system from scratch, Kirby music extends the Peppa music controller.

```js
import PeppaMusic from "../../peppa-pig/levels/PeppaMusic.js";

class KirbyLevelMusic extends PeppaMusic {
```

- `import PeppaMusic` = reuses an existing music system
- `extends` = inherits the old behavior
- `KirbyLevelMusic` = customizes it for this project

## PART 2 - Attaching music per level

Each level creates its own music controller during setup.

```js
this.levelMusic = new KirbyLevelMusic({
  levelName: 'Seek',
  buttonId: 'kirby-seek-music-toggle'
}).attach();
```

- `levelName` = tells the controller which track/context it is serving
- `buttonId` = unique DOM ID for the music toggle button
- `attach()` = mounts the controller and its listeners

## PART 3 - Cleaning up when a level ends

The level destroys the controller in `destroy()` so buttons and audio do not leak between minigames.

```js
this.levelMusic?.destroy?.();
this.levelMusic = null;
```

- `destroy()` = removes listeners and stops leftover audio state
- `?.` = safely calls cleanup only if the controller exists
- `null` = clears the reference after teardown

### Sprite swapping and UI system breakdown

## PART 1 - Defining sprite options in one list

Seek stores all playable sprite choices in one configuration array.

```js
const spriteOptions = [
  { label: "Boy", src: getKirbyImageUrl('boysprite.png') },
  { label: "Scuba Diver", src: getKirbyImageUrl('scubadiver.png') },
  { label: "Astro", src: getKirbyImageUrl('astro.png') },
];
```

- `spriteOptions` = one place for character data
- `label` = what the button shows
- `src` = which sprite sheet to load
- this makes the menu easy to expand without rewriting swap logic

## PART 2 - Updating the current player without respawning

The menu changes the existing player's sprite data in place.

```js
player.data.src = spriteOption.src;
player.data.pixels = { ...spriteOption.pixels };
player.scaleFactor = spriteOption.SCALE_FACTOR;
player.spriteSheet.src = spriteOption.src;
```

- `player.data.src` = switches the image file
- `pixels` = updates sprite sheet dimensions
- `scaleFactor` = changes how large the character is drawn
- no new player object is created

## PART 3 - Building HUD elements directly in JavaScript

Basketball creates its timer and message HUD from code instead of static HTML.

```js
this.timeHud = document.createElement('div');
this.messageHud = document.createElement('div');
container.appendChild(this.timeHud);
container.appendChild(this.messageHud);
```

- `timeHud` = shows survival time and score info
- `messageHud` = shows caught/win messages
- `appendChild()` = inserts the UI into the live game container

## PART 4 - Updating on-screen UI based on game state

The HUD text changes as the round progresses.

```js
this.timeHud.textContent =
  `Time: ${this.currentTime.toFixed(1)}s/${this.targetSurvivalSeconds}s | Best: ${this.bestTime.toFixed(1)}s`;
```

- `textContent` = replaces the HUD text directly
- `currentTime` = live survival timer
- `targetSurvivalSeconds` = win condition goal
- `bestTime` = saved personal best

### Collision system (Triple Chocolate)

We used more than one kind of collision logic depending on the minigame.

In Basketball, the player and chaser use a rectangle-style hitbox collision:

```javascript
isHitboxCollision(a, b) {
  const ar = this.getHitboxRect(a);
  const br = this.getHitboxRect(b);
  return (
    ar.left   < br.right  &&
    ar.right  > br.left   &&
    ar.top    < br.bottom &&
    ar.bottom > br.top
  );
}
```

That is used to detect when Kirby catches the player.

Projectiles use circle-to-rectangle collision so a thrown basketball can stun the chaser:

```javascript
isCircleHittingObject(projectile, obj) {
  const rect = this.getHitboxRect(obj);
  const nearestX = Math.max(rect.left, Math.min(projectile.x, rect.right));
  const nearestY = Math.max(rect.top,  Math.min(projectile.y, rect.bottom));
  const dx = projectile.x - nearestX;
  const dy = projectile.y - nearestY;
  return (dx * dx + dy * dy) <= (projectile.radius * projectile.radius);
}
```

In Aquatic, the shark uses built-in collision checking against the player and triggers a game over when the hit lands:

```javascript
shark.isCollision(player);
if (shark.collisionData?.hit) {
  this.showSharkGameOver();
}
```

This gave us multiple collision styles in one project: collectibles, enemy contact, and projectile combat.

### NPC chasing behavior (Team Ocean and Space)

The Basketball minigame includes active enemy pursuit instead of a static NPC.

Kirby chases the player by computing the direction vector from Kirby to the player, normalizing that vector, and moving a little each frame:

```javascript
const dx = player.position.x - lebron.position.x;
const dy = player.position.y - lebron.position.y;
const dist = Math.hypot(dx, dy);
if (dist < 1) return;

const speed = Math.min(2.1 + this.currentTime * 0.03, 2.8);
lebron.position.x += (dx / dist) * speed;
lebron.position.y += (dy / dist) * speed;
```

We also clamp Kirby back into the visible court so the chase stays fair and readable. On top of that, the speed increases slightly over time, which makes the survival challenge harder the longer the player lasts.

Aquatic also has shark movement and collision pressure, but Basketball is the clearest example of a direct chasing system.

### Multiplayer system (Sprinting Snails)

The aquatic level supports optional two-player story play by reading a `room` query parameter from the URL:

```javascript
const roomParam = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("room");
applyWorldSize(roomParam ? 2 : 1);
```

When co-op is active, the level expands the world width and resizes the game container:

```javascript
const applyWorldSize = (playerCount = 1, options = {}) => {
  const nextDimensions = getWorldDimensionsForPlayerCount(playerCount);
  this.gameEnv.innerWidth = nextDimensions.width;
  this.gameEnv.innerHeight = nextDimensions.height;
  this.gameEnv.size?.();
};
```

The actual multiplayer loop starts in `startMultiplayer()` and uses `BroadcastChannel` when available, with `localStorage` events as a fallback:

```javascript
if (typeof BroadcastChannel !== "undefined") {
  const channel = new BroadcastChannel(this.multiplayer.channelName);
  channel.onmessage = (event) => handleMultiplayerMessage(event.data);
  this.multiplayer.channel = channel;
}
```

The level also sends regular player state updates so the remote player can be rendered and kept in sync:

```javascript
this.multiplayer.heartbeatTimer = setInterval(() => {
  const player = this.getLocalPlayer?.();
  if (!player) return;
  broadcastMultiplayerMessage({
    type: "state",
    x: player.position?.x || 0,
    y: player.position?.y || 0,
    direction: player.direction || "down",
  });
}, 120);
```

Beyond movement syncing, the aquatic level also broadcasts quest and scene events such as starting quests, collecting objectives, and switching between underwater and surface scenes.

### Music system (Team Pranigas)

We added music only to the Kirby minigame levels by creating `KirbyLevelMusic.js`.

Instead of rewriting the whole audio system from scratch, the project extends `PeppaMusic` and adapts it for Kirby:

```javascript
import PeppaMusic from "../../peppa-pig/levels/PeppaMusic.js";

class KirbyLevelMusic extends PeppaMusic {
```

The Kirby wrapper adds level-safe behavior:

- removes duplicate music buttons
- stores player preference in `localStorage`
- pauses and destroys audio when a level ends
- keeps only one active music controller at a time

The button and playback lifecycle are handled in the controller itself:

```javascript
attach() {
  if (this.enabled) {
    this.addGestureListeners();
  }
  this.updateButton();
  return this;
}
```

Each level creates its own music controller during `initialize()` and removes it during `destroy()`, which keeps the music scoped to only these three levels:

```javascript
this.levelMusic = new KirbyLevelMusic({
  levelName: "Aquatic",
  buttonId: "kirby-aquatic-music-toggle",
}).attach();
```

This same pattern is also used in Seek and Basketball.

### Sprite swapping and UI systems (Team Space)

Seek includes a full sprite menu that lets the player swap characters while the game is running. That is more advanced than a single fixed player sprite because it updates the player's sprite sheet data, animation settings, and image source on the fly.

The project also adds several UI systems built directly in JavaScript:

- quest HUD in Aquatic
- challenge HUD and leaderboard UI in Aquatic
- top menu bar for mode switching and multiplayer access
- sprite menu and hint badge in Seek
- timer HUD and message HUD in Basketball
- fade overlays for transitions

These systems matter because they are part of the gameplay loop, not just decoration.

## How We Tested

- Read the implemented level source files directly and documented only features that are actually present in code
- Verified the transition chain from `GameLevelAquaticGameLevel.js` to `GameLevelSeek.js` to `GameLevelBasketball.js`
- Verified that collision helpers, chase logic, multiplayer setup, and level music hooks all exist in the project files
- Verified that `KirbyLevelMusic.js` is attached in Aquatic, Seek, and Basketball and destroyed when those levels are destroyed
- Confirmed that the aquatic level includes story mode, challenge mode, multiplayer state syncing, and boss encounter logic
- Tried to run a JavaScript syntax check earlier, but `node` is not installed in this environment, so I could not do a local parser or browser runtime check here

## What We Learned

- A multi-level game is easier to explain when the documentation includes both gameplay features and the code systems behind them
- Game-in-game transitions need cleanup logic, not just visual fades
- Collision is not one single feature; different gameplay systems needed different collision strategies
- Multiplayer required both rendering changes and state synchronization, not just a second player sprite
- Music systems also need lifecycle management so audio and buttons do not leak across levels

## Controls and Gameplay Notes

- In Aquatic, progression is mainly driven by interacting with Mermaid and Slime
- In Seek, press `Q` to open the sprite menu
- In Basketball, press `E` to shoot and `R` to restart after getting caught
- The Basketball win condition is surviving for `20` seconds
- Aquatic supports optional co-op play when the level is launched with a `room` parameter

## Next Step

- Add screenshots or short GIF evidence for each system so the documentation includes both code explanation and visual proof
- Expand this page again if more minigames or shared systems are added later
