## Directory Structure

Project-friendly project organization for the introductory gamify experience.

```text
_projects/gamify/
├── index.ipynb
├── levels/
│   ├── GameLevelWater.js
│   ├── GameLevelDesert.js
│   ├── GameLevelEnd.js
│   └── GameLevelOverworld.js
├── model/
├── images/
└── docs/
    └── README.md
```

Runtime/distributed outputs are generated into GitHub Pages folders by Makefile:

- _notebooks/projects/gamify/
- _posts/projects/gamify/
- assets/js/projects/gamify/
- images/projects/gamify/

## Development Workflow

Primary SDLC workflow:

```bash
make dev
```

This is the main build-and-test loop for development. It starts Jekyll and the registered project watchers so edits are copied, converted, and regenerated automatically.

Validate this project after make dev when you want to force a full re-copy of distributed files.

Use this when:

- You renamed files or folders.
- You want to confirm files were copied to expected runtime directories.
- You want to isolate one project's distribution behavior while debugging.

```bash
make -C _projects/gamify build
make -C _projects/gamify docs # docs are not in make dev
```

Validate all registered projects when you need a repo-wide distribution refresh or consistency check.

Use this when:

- Multiple projects were renamed or restructured.
- You want to verify all registered project outputs in one run.
- You want a quick pre-commit sanity check for project distribution.

```bash
make build-registered-projects
make build-registered-docs # docs are not in make dev
```

## CI/CD Targets and Action Logs

GitHub Actions uses the same registered targets:

```yaml
- name: Build registered projects
  run: |
    make build-registered-projects
    make build-registered-docs
```

Expected Actions log lines for project-level visibility:

- 📦 Building project: gamify
- 📚 Building docs for: gamify

If docs verification is enabled in workflow, expect summary lines similar to:

- Registered project docs found: <count>
- Sample generated docs:

These logs are the quickest way to confirm _projects registration and distribution are running in CI.

## Edit/Save Workflow

1. Edit files in _projects/gamify/
2. Save file and let auto-distribution run.
3. Jekyll regenerates affected pages.
4. Refresh browser and validate changes.

## Path Guidance

Use runtime absolute paths in code.

```javascript
// Image path from gameEnv
const sprite = gameEnv.path + '/images/projects/gamify/knight.png';

// Shared game engine import
import GameControl from '/assets/js/GameEnginev1.1/essentials/GameControl.js';
```

## Registration Model

Project integration into Makefile is registration-based.

1. Add project name to _projects/.makeprojects.
2. Use the project Makefile template targets: build, clean, watch, docs, docs-clean.
3. For new projects, typically only DATE_OF_CREATION and project files change.

No Makefile fragments or project-specific root targets are required.

## Version Control Strategy

Track source files in _projects. Treat distributed files as generated artifacts.

```gitignore
# Track source
!_projects/gamify/**

# Ignore generated distribution
_notebooks/projects/gamify/
assets/js/projects/gamify/
images/projects/gamify/
_posts/projects/gamify/
```

## Notes

### Player movement and animation

All reference-game players (including both End players and the Star Wars level)
use GameEngine v1.1's equal-axis movement and `ANIMATION_FPS: 8`. `STEP_FACTOR`
still controls width-based movement pace; reducing canvas height no longer slows
vertical input. Sprite frames advance by elapsed time, separately from movement.

NPC animation rates are intentionally unchanged. Gravity in the Water level and
existing controls, collision behavior, and sprite directions are preserved.
Movement is still update-count-based, so this is not yet a fixed-timestep engine.

After editing these sources, publish them with
`make -C _projects/games/gamify build`. Do not edit distributed level files.

This OVERVIEW is the baseline introduction to the build system concepts. Real-world, deeper references belong in the cs-pathway docs.
